# Easy Sripts Ruby (old)

This repository contains scripts I create on my day-to-day basis to assist with testing or any other simple tasks.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and use these scripts as needed for your own projects or tasks.

## Creating Executables for Windows

To create an executable for Windows, you can use the Gem Ocra. 

You can find more information and download the Gem from the following link:
[Ocra Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/ocra/versions/1.3.6)
